    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time Complexity is a way to describe the efficiency of an algorithm, particularly in terms of how the runtime of the algorithm increases as the size of the input increases. It's typically expressed using Big-O notation (e.g., O(n), O(log n), O(n²)), which gives an upper bound on the time required as a function of the input size. Time complexity helps identify the most efficient algorithms for specific problems.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. Similar to time complexity, it is typically expressed using Big-O notation (e.g., O(1), O(n), O(n²)), and it represents the maximum space an algorithm might require to execute. Understanding Space Complexity is crucial for optimizing resource usage, especially in memory-constrained environments.
